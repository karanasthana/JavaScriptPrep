Every time you write a program in javascript, it runs in an environment and that environment is called execution context. There are two types of execution contexts: <ul><li>Global Execution Context</li><li>Execution Context created every time after a function is created. Every time a function is called the new execution context is pushed to the top of the global execution context, which makes an execution stack.</li></ul>An undeclared variable is assigned the value undefined at execution and is also type undefined.

In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time. A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created.</p> <p>what happens internally is: outer function execution goes into the execution stack first, then the variables goes into symbols table. Variable remains there till the execution of the function is completed. Then comes the inner function, it goes in execution stack and can access variable from symbols table. Once the execution of outer function is completed you can&#39;t access the variable outside. Also, you can&#39;t access the variables declared inside the inner function. <code>function runExecution() { var a = 10; function add(b){ var b = 20;return a + b;} add();}</code></p><p>Further explanation to that &quot;reference&quot; concept: Point 1: &quot;An object is marked as eligible to be garbage collected when it can no longer be accessed.&quot; As you can&#39;t initiate garbage collection process manually in javascript, JS engine determines the eligibility of an object for GC using the above mentioned point. FYI, this is applicable for all types of objects.</p><p>But if there&#39;s a reference somewhere, which means if it can still be accessed (In case of closure, inner function still has reference preserved for variables defined in outer function), which means it still stays in the Heap memory &amp; garbage collector doesn&#39;t consider these variables.</p> "},{"question":"<h3>Spread and Rest operator</h3>","answer":"<p>The spread operator takes an array (or any iterable) and spreads its values.

Explain unidirectional flow.","answer":"React is unidirectional. <br/> Unidirection flow is one where you can pass on data in any one direction (either always parent to child or always child to parent). <br/> React JS is an unidirectional flow wherein data can be passed only from parent to child."},{"question":"Why is setState() async","answer":"setState() is async because React intelligently combines several setState functions into one and thus, change the virtual DOM only once for several setState calls performed in a short span of time. Also, there is no guarantee that the state has been updated if we try to access the value immediately"},{"question":"Is there any memory leak in react?","answer":"Can\'t perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in the componentWillUnmount method."},{"question":"examples of HOC","answer":"Refer to important links"},{"question":"how do you create react builds","answer":"We use <strong>npm</strong> to create react builds. Using the commands <code>npm run build</code>. Ususally the build script is run using this command. Commonly the build script is used to create minified deployable versions of all the javascript code into one, all the css code into one and all HTML into one."},{"question":"What are Pure Components","answer":"React.PureComponent is similar to React.Component. The difference between them is that React.Component doesn\u2019t implement shouldComponentUpdate(), but React.PureComponent implements it with a shallow prop and state comparison. If your React component\u2019s render() function renders the same result given the same props and state, you can use React.PureComponent for a performance boost in some cases."},{"question":"Alternative of React.PureComponent","answer":""},{"question":"If parent component contains a child component, Will child component re renders if render function of parent is called?","answer":"Yes, and to avoid this we should use pure components."},{"question":"if there are multiple css files in components and one in global how are they loaded?","answer":""},{"question":"If you have a lot of components and page is taking a lot of time to load how will you check where is the code failing?","answer":""},{"question":"How to do server side rendering?","answer":""},{"question":"React lazy loading and Suspense","answer":"React.lazy() and < Suspense />"},{"question":"how to cancel fetch operation if previous fetch didn\'t return a response?","answer":""},{"question":"Apply something in a DOM node like document.getElementById in react","answer":"use React.findDOMNode()"},{"question":"Reason behind not using id as an index in map","answer":""},{"question":"Difference between state and props","answer":""},{"question":"Why should we not mutate state directly? By assigning like <code>this.state.a = 10</code>","answer":"setState() is not immediate. It queues a state transition based on what it thinks is going on which may not include the direct changes to this.state. Since it\'s queued rather than applied immediately, it\'s entirely possible that something is modified in between such that your direct changes get overwritten. Basically, if you modify this.state directly, you create a situation where those modifications might get overwritten."},{"question":"Why this.setState should not be called inside render method?","answer":" setState() calls render, and calling a function mutating the state inside render generally leads to an infinite loop."}]}')},24:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"topic":"Redux","importantLinks":[{"link":"https://frontarm.com/james-k-nelson/when-context-replaces-redux/#:~:text=React\'s%20context%20API%20does%20basically,whole%20toolkit%20for%20managing%20state%3A&text=It%20provides%20a%20middleware%20API,to%20tools%20like%20redux%2Dsagas","text":"Context API and when to choose it over Redux"},{"link":"https://www.educba.com/redux-alternatives/","text":"What is Redux and it\'s alternatives"},{"link":"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/redux-redux-intro#:~:text=Redux%20is%20a%20predictable%20state,just%20plain%20old%20vanilla%20JavaScript.","text":"Redux\'s Core Concepts and design pattern"}],"logo":"https://javascript-prep.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/redux-logo.png","questionsAndAnswers":[{"question":"Reducers","answer":"Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state. <br /> The state of a store is updated by means of reducer functions.

This interception will generate a new application state. From here the actions will be propagated down through a hierarchy of components from Redux store."},{"question":"Store","answer":"The store holds the application state and supplies the helper methods for accessing the state, register listeners and dispatch actions. There is only one Store while using Redux. The store is configured via the <strong>createStorefunction</strong>. The single store represents the entire state. Rducers return a state via action <br /> <code>export function configureStore(initialState) { return createStore(rootReducer, initialState); }</code> <br /> The root reducer is a collection of all reducers in the application."},{"question":"Why is Redux Thunk used","answer":"Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState() as parameters. Thereby, middlewares like Redux Thunk or Redux Sagas are used to make the Redux asynchronous."}]}')},47:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/coding.ac092b15.jpg"},48:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/mobile-dev.ad3dfdd1.jpg"},49:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/computer-table.4fdf6d5b.jpg"},50:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/computer.a277703e.jpg"},54:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/common.122b5b53.webp"},57:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n(113)},62:function(e,t,n){},63:function(e,t,n){},93:function(e,t){}},[[57,1,2]]]);
